### About me:

I am currently a PhD student at the University of Glasgow, United Kingdom and expect to graduate in October 2018.  My PhD research is focused on  developing **"Spatial clustering techniques for  urban road networks using spatio-temporal data"**. My supervisors are Dr. Ludger Evers, School of Mathematics and Statistics and Dr. Konstantinos Ampountolas, School of Engineering at the University of Glasgow. I also benefit from the research environment at the Urban Big Data Centre, University of Glasgow and am currently funded by the Lord Kelvin Adam Smith scholarship.  

Previously, I received a *Diploma in Economics* from the University of London in 2009, a *B.Sc. in Mathematics with Economics* from the University of East Anglia, UK in 2011 and a *M.S. in Biostatistics* from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities in 2014. I also spent a year working in actuarial positions in Dubai, United Arab Emirates before deciding to go to graduate school. 

I was born in India and grew up in the expatriate community in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. I speak English as a first language and have varying degrees of proficiency in other languages that include Arabic, Tamil, Hindi, and Telugu.
