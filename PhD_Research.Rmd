The *primary focus* of the PhD project is to develop **clustering techniques** for urban road networks using **spatio-temporal data**. We utilise a downtown San Francisco grid style urban network and corresponding occupancy observations that are recorded over a period of six hours with a defined sampling rate. The observations are recorded using inductive loop detectors and are generated using an AIMSUN simulator.
