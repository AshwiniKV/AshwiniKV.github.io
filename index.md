## Ashwini Venkatasubramaniam

### I am currently a PhD student at the University of Glasgow, United Kingdom and expect to graduate in October 2018.  My PhD research is focused on  developing "Spatial clustering techniques for  urban road networks using spatio-temporal data".

I received a Diploma in Economics from the University of London in 2009, a B.Sc. in Mathematics with Economics from the University of East Anglia, UK in 2011 and a M.S. in Biostatistics from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities in 2014. 

I was born in India and raised in the expatriate community in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. I speak English as a first language and have varying degrees of proficiency in other languages that include Arabic, Tamil, Hindi, and Telugu. In my spare time, I like to drink tea, dream on rainy days, and visit castles in Scotland.
